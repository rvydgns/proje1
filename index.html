            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Fyodor Dostoevsky</p>
            <p><strong>Language:</strong> Russian</p>
            <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Literaty Fiction</p>
            <p><strong>Original Name:</strong> Преступленіе и наказаніе</p>
            <p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 1866</p>
            <p><strong>Pages:</strong> 545</p>
            <p><strong>Brief Summary:</strong> The book is about the psychological turmoil of a young student named Raskolnikov. Drawing on his theories about morality and the concept of "superman", Raskolnikov commits a murder to test his beliefs. The novel explores the consequences of his actions, the psychological impact of guilt, and the journey towards redemption. Raskolnikov's internal struggles and interactions with other characters provide an in-depth exploration of morality, justice, and the human condition.</p>
            <p><strong>My favorite quote from the book: “That’s why they instinctively dislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they explain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the living process of life; they don’t want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde!”</strong> </p>
